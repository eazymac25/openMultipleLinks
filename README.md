# Open Multiple Links
### Chrome Extension to open multiple links by dragging your cursor over the page


Creating a chrome extension to make browsing easier by open multiple links at once simply by dragging your mouse. 


Concept is pretty simple. There are normally many cases when a user would like to easily open a list of links on a page in new tabs. Instead of clicking on each individual link, a user should be able to select multiple links and open them in new tabs all at once. 

That's exactly what this extension allows you to do. Just SHIFT + CLICK + DRAG and you can select a set of relevant links. On letting go of the click the links will all open in new tabs.
